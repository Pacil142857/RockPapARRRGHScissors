#Inspiration
Renowned game developer Masahiro Sakurai made a YouTube video describing his involvement with the game Sodatete! Mushiking. This game had the same basic gameplay premise as our game: rock-paper-scissors, but one of the options is stronger than usual. We all liked the gameplay concept, so we tweaked it a little (by modifying how certain options get stronger) and made it pirate-themed.

#What it does
Our project is a simple game of rock-paper-scissors, but it's themed as flintlock-cutlass-blunderbuss. After each round, one of the loser's attack choices will gain a special effect (e.g., double damage, healing on hit, winning ties). There's a local multiplayer mode and a singleplayer mode with 6 different opponents to choose from. Each opponent has a different strategy, so you'll have to adjust your strategy accordingly.

#How we built it
All of the code was done through Python and Pygame. We made it a point to make our code be very object-oriented, which is why we have so many classes (e.g., Attack, Player, Game, Menu, etc.).
